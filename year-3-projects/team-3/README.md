**Title**: Evaluation of Tropical Cloud Simulations between CMIP6 Models and Satellite Observations

**Team members**: Achala W. Denagamage, Neranga Hannadige, Sahara Ali, Xin Huang

**Mentors**: Dr. Jianwu Wang

**Abstract**: In this project, we look at the Global Climate Models (GCM) of CMIP6 (6th generation of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project). We analyze the cloud parameterizations of three CMIP6 models, namely, NASA-GISS-E2.1-G, NCAR-CESM2 and NOAA-GFDL-CM4,  and compare the model outputs  against observational data from two satellites, namely, GOCCP-CALIPSO and CERES.
A common issue related to cloud parameterization when studying earlier versions of GCMs is called “Too few too bright” problem, which is related to tropical low-level clouds. In this report, we compare the percentage low, medium and high level clouds and shortwave radiative flux in Earth's tropical region. Our analysis suggests that the CMIP6-era models no longer have the 'too bright' problem, however, the 'too few' problem still prevails.

**Structures of implementation**:

**Instructions on how to run the code**: Instructions for downloading datasets and running analysis code has been provided in individual Readme files in their respective repositories/folders.
